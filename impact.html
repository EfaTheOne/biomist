                        <strong>Universal Benefit:</strong> There is no limit of gender when it comes to our product
                        benefiting people. It supports farmers of all genders equally.
                    </p>

                        <strong>For Children:</strong> It benefits farmer kids because it makes chores and work for them
                        easier. But every kid whose produce has been affected by our product will benefit by having
                        <strong>healthier and better crops</strong> to eat, leading to a better lifestyle.

                        <strong>Universalization & Homogenization:</strong> We want BioMist to universally change the
                        lives of farmers. As farmers worldwide adopt our product, they become connected in a shared
                        community of BioMist users—homogenized by a shared standard of higher efficiency and health.

                        <strong>Communication Technology:</strong> We use the internet to spread the word. We can't just
                        sell locally; we need websites and digital ads to open our idea to the world and promote this
                        global consciousness.

                        Our company goals do not explicitly interpret democracy, but we support human rights by
                        providing essential access. Everyone should have the right to do what they please, including
                        accessing simple farming tools that lead to advanced progress like our product.

                    <p style="opacity: 0.8;">
                        Farming is getting harder. Farmers and the agricultural sector are a minority group we actively
                        support. By supplying a product that reduces crop loss and increases value, we help keep the
                        farming community and culture alive and thriving.
                    </p>

                        <strong>Marginalization:</strong> Some farmers are economically challenged and pushed to
                        society's edges. We want to reintroduce them back into society and make them appreciated in all
                        social aspects.

                            Once established, we plan to outsource manufacturing to countries that rely on farming. This
                            strategy lowers costs and directly supports the economies where our product is needed most,
                            fostering true global interdependence.
